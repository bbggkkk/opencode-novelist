Completion rule: every mandatory step for the active route must have concrete evidence before `Status` can be set to `COMPLETED`. Do not mark steps complete from assumptions, simulations, summaries, or user requests to skip verification. Evidence can include invoked sub-agent name, source files read, validator command/result, Otaku report, Editor audit result, draft hash, canon snapshot hash, manifest row, Verification Evidence path, and commit hash.

Scope rule: `Status` cannot be set to `COMPLETED` until the Requested Scope of Work and Completion Target are satisfied. Do not stop at a beat, paragraph, scene, chapter, or intermediate revision pass when the user's initial request requires a larger unit such as a full section, full book, or full work.

Growth rule: do not start leaf drafting until the Macro Skeleton and Execution Unit Queue exist. Every drafted unit must map to a Parent Branch, and every completed unit must have a Skeleton Drift Log entry proving it still serves the branch or that an approved/safe skeleton update was recorded.

## Resume Checklist

- [ ] Confirm Requested Scope of Work and Completion Target are recorded.
- [ ] Confirm Macro Skeleton and Execution Unit Queue exist before drafting.
- [ ] Confirm each completed unit has a Skeleton Drift Log entry.
- [ ] Confirm target draft exists or is intentionally new.
- [ ] Confirm target draft hash matches Last Verified Draft SHA256, unless Last Stable Stage is NONE.
- [ ] Confirm canon snapshot hash matches Last Verified Canon Snapshot SHA256, unless Last Stable Stage is NONE.
- [ ] Confirm verification-manifest.md contains Last Verification Manifest Row, unless Last Stable Stage is NONE.
- [ ] Confirm Last Verification Evidence exists and matches the manifest row, unless Last Stable Stage is NONE.
- [ ] Confirm narrative-state.md includes Last Narrative State Update, unless Last Stable Stage is NONE.
- [ ] Confirm locked context hashes before applying any revision.
- [ ] Re-run verification for any temporary work before applying or consolidating it.
