# Agent Design

## Architecture

This pack uses a **hierarchical agent architecture** with two router agents at the top level, each managing specialized sub-agents.

```
Novelist (Router) — feedback loop orchestrator
├── novelist-writer — fiction writing (scenes, dialogue, plot, narration)
├── novelist-editor — fiction editing (plot, character, prose, pacing)
├── novelist-researcher — research & LaTeX paper writing
├── novelist-loremaster — setting archivist (context retrieval from files)
├── novelist-otaku — setting verifier (consistency checking)
└── novelist-publisher — EPUB book compiler (packages drafts using zip)

Lyricist (Router)
├── lyricist-writer — lyric writing (K-pop, ballad, hip-hop, indie, OST)
└── lyricist-editor — lyric editing (hook, rhyme, flow, pronunciation)
```

## Feedback Loop

The Novelist router runs a **structured feedback loop** for all writing requests, using a sequential paragraph-by-paragraph / beat-by-beat buildup model to guarantee near-perfect narrative consistency and logical transitions:

```
 ① Loremaster → collect setting & narrative state
        │
 ② Router → Decompose scene brief into sequential beats/paragraphs
        │
 ┌─────►③ Loop: For each scene-beat:
 │      │
 │   ④ Writer → writes next beat/paragraph based on accumulated prefix & settings
 │      │
 │   ⑤ Otaku → cross-examines next beat draft against accumulated prefix, outline, & settings
 │     ╱ ╲
 │  PASS  FAIL
 │    │      ├── [Resolved by Hierarchy] ──> ⑥ Editor → fixes errors using Otaku report & change log ──> re-verify
 │    │      └── [Unresolvable or User Intervention] ──> ⑦ Halt Loop & Initiate Collaborative Discussion
 │    ▼
 └─── Consolidate beat into accumulated prefix (repeat until all beats done)
        │
        ▼
    ⑧ Done & Publish → compile final consolidated draft into EPUB using zip
```

### Loop Safety & Collaborative Discussion
- **Step-by-Step Buildup**: Rather than drafting a whole chapter, the router decomposes the scene brief. Each segment/paragraph is generated, verified, and revised in isolation. Once verified, it is locked into the **Accumulated Prefix Text** which acts as canon context for all subsequent segments.
- **Setting-First Conflict Resolution Hierarchy**: Sub-agents automatically resolve contradictions using the priority order:
  - **Priority 1: Individual Entity Settings (개별 캐릭터/대상 설정 문서)** — Ultimate canon (e.g. character profiles).
  - **Priority 2: General Lore & World-Building Settings (일반 세계관/시스템 설정 문서)** — Overrides plot progression.
  - **Priority 3: Recent Narrative State (최근 서사 상태/이전 장 내용)** — Overrides transient user prompts.
  - **Priority 4: User Brief / Transient Prompt (사용자 지시어)** — Lowest priority. Cannot violate established settings.
- **Strict Verification**: Loop safety iteration limits and relaxed warnings are removed. Verification is always 100% strict.
- **Collaborative Discussion Protocol**: If settings directly contradict each other or if the user intervenes, the loop halts, and the agent initiates a discussion presenting Priority 1, 2, and 3 settings details to align them.

The same agents can also be invoked directly:

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `/novelist write Chapter 3` | Sequential feedback loop & EPUB compilation (①→②→③→④↺→⑧) |
| `/novelist publish Chapter 3` | EPUB compilation only via `@novelist-publisher` |
| `/novelist-loremaster collect setting on protagonist` | Setting document only |
| `/novelist-otaku verify this draft` | Verification only |
| `/novelist-otaku PASS` | Verification passed |
| `/novelist-otaku FAIL + report` | Needs revision |
| `/novelist-publisher compile book` | EPUB compilation only |

## Router Design

Each router agent analyzes the user's natural language request and **delegates** to the appropriate sub-agent via opencode's `@agent-name` syntax:

| Router | Input Signal | Routes To |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| `novelist` | create, write, draft, scene, chapter | Full feedback loop & publishing → loremaster → writer → otaku → editor → publisher |
| `novelist` | publish, epub, package, compile | `@novelist-publisher` |
| `novelist` | fix, review, feedback, revise, edit | `@novelist-editor` → `@novelist-otaku` |
| `novelist` | paper, latex, experiment, research | `@novelist-researcher` |
| `novelist` | setting, context, lore, find | `@novelist-loremaster` |
| `novelist` | verify, check, validate | `@novelist-otaku` |
| `lyricist` | create, write, draft, verse, chorus, lyric | `@lyricist-writer` |
| `lyricist` | fix, review, feedback, revise, polish | `@lyricist-editor` |

Routers never attempt to perform the work themselves — they evaluate the request and hand off a complete brief to the sub-agent.

## Multi-Volume & Series Architecture

The system supports dynamically expanding series through an isomorphic multi-volume layout:
- **Global settings (`settings/`)**: World rules, magic systems, and base character profiles remain identical for all volumes.
- **Series Bible (`series-bible.md`)**: Acts as a central ledger tracking the chronological sequence, summaries of previous volumes, character status evolution (ages, injuries), and unresolved plot threads.
- **Volume Directories (`volume-N/`)**: Individual folders for each volume. A single-volume project utilizes `volume-1/`, while sequels add `volume-2/` and so forth.
- **Volume Routing**: The router detects the targeted volume from user parameters or folder structures, directing `@novelist-loremaster` to fetch previous summaries from the Series Bible, and `@novelist-publisher` to output compiled `.epub` files directly in `volume-N/`.

## Separation of Concerns

The design separates creation from feedback at every level:

- **Writer agents** (`novelist-writer`, `lyricist-writer`) produce drafts with high temperature (0.8)
- **Editor agents** (`novelist-editor`, `lyricist-editor`) diagnose problems with low temperature (0.4–0.45)
- **Research agent** (`novelist-researcher`) combines analysis and writing with low temperature (0.3)
- **Setting agents** (`novelist-loremaster`, `novelist-otaku`) provide factual grounding with low temperature (0.2)
- **Router agents** (`novelist`, `lyricist`) classify and delegate with low temperature (0.3)

The **loremaster → writer → otaku → editor → otaku** feedback loop ensures that every draft is:
1. Grounded in established setting (loremaster)
2. Creatively written (writer)
3. Rigorously verified (otaku)
4. Corrected if needed (editor)
5. Re-verified until clean (otaku)

This separation helps users run a draft-review-rewrite loop without mixing creative generation and critique in a single role.

## Language, Culture & Creative Profiling Policy

Agents write in the language and style explicitly requested by the user. 

1. **Upfront Information Gathering**: If key parameters such as Style/Tone, Mood/Atmosphere, Language, or Cultural Background are missing, ambiguous, or unclear from the user's initial prompt, the router agents (`/novelist`, `/lyricist`) will ask the user *once* at the beginning to gather and align these parameters.
2. **Unified Profile Enforcement**: These parameters are compiled into a unified **Writing & Creative Profile** (or **Lyric Profile**). The routers propagate this profile to all sub-agents (Writer, Editor, Otaku, Researcher, Loremaster). Every stage of the workflow—including initial drafting, review, editing/revising, and setting verification—strictly adheres to this profile to maintain creative consistency.
3. **Language Defaults**: If unspecified, the language defaults to Korean.
4. **Cultural Context Inference**: The cultural context is inferred based on the target language and its corresponding country/countries. If ambiguous, the agents prompt the user to input it.
5. **Korean-First Creative Writing**: Korean is the default context. When writing in Korean, all agents prioritize natural Korean prose, believable dialogue, emotional continuity, Korean lyric pronunciation, and genre-specific expectations, representing a Korean cultural background.

## Safety And Originality

The agents should avoid direct imitation of living authors, specific copyrighted songs, and protected lyrics. They can work from broad creative traits such as atmosphere, structure, emotion, tempo, or genre.

## Distribution Model

Users install agents via the interactive `install.sh` script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bbggkkk/opencode-agent-pack.git
cd opencode-agent-pack
./install.sh
```

The script accepts an optional argument for non-interactive use:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbggkkk/opencode-agent-pack/master/install.sh | sh -s -- 1
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bbggkkk/opencode-agent-pack/master/install.sh | sh -s -- 2
```

- `1` → project-local install (`.opencode/agents/`)
- `2` → global install (`~/.config/opencode/agents/`)

Manual copy is also supported:

```bash
cp -r agents/* ~/.config/opencode/agents/
```

After installation, restart opencode for changes to take effect.

## Skill Mapping

Each agent is paired with specific opencode skills that enhance its capabilities.

| Skill | Used By | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `brainstorming` | novelist-writer, novelist-editor, lyricist-writer | Creative exploration before drafting or revision |
| `writing-plans` | novelist-writer | Multi-step plan generation for episode outlines |
| `brainstorming-research-ideas` | novelist-researcher | Ideation for new research directions |
| `dispatching-parallel-agents` | novelist, lyricist | Parallel execution of independent sub-agent calls |
| `executing-plans` | novelist, lyricist | Structured execution of multi-step plans |
| `setting-collapse-detector` | novelist-loremaster, novelist-otaku | Systematic setting consistency verification |

### Skill Invocation

- **setting-collapse-detector** is invoked automatically by `@novelist-otaku` on every draft verification, and by `@novelist-loremaster` after collecting setting info to check for internal contradictions.
- **brainstorming** is invoked by writer/editor agents when the brief is open-ended or when multiple creative approaches need exploration.
- **dispatching-parallel-agents** is used by routers when multiple independent sub-agent tasks can run simultaneously.
- All agents with skill access declare `skill: allow` in their YAML permission block to enable skill invocation.
