# Korean Creative Agents for opencode

A hierarchical Korean creative agent pack for opencode. The **Novelist** and **Lyricist** routers analyze requests and delegate to specialized sub-agents through a structured feedback loop.

## Agents

### Novelist System

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `/novelist` | **Router** — analyzes requests, orchestrates the feedback loop |
| `/novelist-writer` | Fiction writing: scenes, dialogue, plot, character emotion, episode drafts |
| `/novelist-editor` | Fiction editing: plot logic, character consistency, prose rhythm, pacing |
| `/novelist-researcher` | Research & LaTeX paper writing: experiment analysis, academic writing |
| `/novelist-loremaster` | Setting archivist: searches files for setting info, compiles structured documents |
| `/novelist-otaku` | Setting verifier: cross-examines drafts against setting for consistency |
| `/novelist-publisher` | EPUB book compiler: compiles verified drafts into standard CSS-styled EPUB books using zip commands |

### Lyricist System

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `/lyricist` | **Router** — analyzes lyric writing/editing requests |
| `/lyricist-writer` | Lyric writing: K-pop, ballad, hip-hop, indie, OST, and adjacent styles |
| `/lyricist-editor` | Lyric editing: hook clarity, rhyme, flow, pronunciation, structure |

### Skill (installed alongside agents)

| Skill | Used By | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `setting-collapse-detector` | Loremaster, Otaku | Systematic framework for detecting character, timeline, geography, world rules, possession, and dialogue inconsistencies |

## Feedback Loop

The Novelist router runs a structured, paragraph-by-paragraph / beat-by-beat buildup feedback loop. Instead of drafting the entire scene at once, it generates and strictly verifies each segment sequentially using a prefix-constrained architecture:

```
 ① Loremaster → collect setting & narrative state
        │
 ② Router → Decompose scene brief into sequential beats/paragraphs
        │
 ┌─────►③ Loop: For each scene-beat:
 │      │
 │   ④ Writer → write next beat/paragraph based on accumulated prefix & settings
 │      │
 │   ⑤ Otaku → verify next beat draft against accumulated prefix, outline, & settings
 │     ╱ ╲
 │  PASS  FAIL
 │    │      ├── [Resolved by Hierarchy] ──> ⑥ Editor → fix next beat draft ──> re-verify
 │    │      └── [Unresolvable or User Intervention] ──> ⑦ Halt Loop & Initiate Collaborative Discussion
 │    ▼
 └─── Consolidate beat into accumulated prefix (repeat until all beats done)
        │
        ▼
    ⑧ Done & Publish → compile final consolidated draft into EPUB using zip
```

### Loop Safety & Collaborative Discussion
- **Step-by-Step Buildup**: Each beat/paragraph is verified and revised individually. Once verified, it becomes part of the permanent "accumulated prefix text" that serves as the absolute canon context for subsequent beats.
- **Setting-First Conflict Resolution Hierarchy**: When resolving contradictions, agents follow a strict priority order: 
  - **Priority 1: Individual Entity Settings (개별 캐릭터/대상 설정 문서)** — Ultimate canon (e.g. character profiles).
  - **Priority 2: General Lore & World-Building Settings (일반 세계관/시스템 설정 문서)** — Overrides plot progression.
  - **Priority 3: Recent Narrative State (최근 서사 상태/이전 장 내용)** — Overrides transient user prompts.
  - **Priority 4: User Brief / Transient Prompt (사용자 지시어)** — Lowest priority. Cannot violate established settings.
- **Strict Verification**: Loop safety iteration limits and relaxed warnings are removed. Verification is always 100% strict.
- **Collaborative Discussion Protocol**: If settings directly contradict each other or if the user intervenes, the loop halts, and the agent initiates a discussion presenting Priority 1, 2, and 3 settings details to align them.

## 3-Level Franchise, Work & Volume Hierarchy Layout

To support writing complex shared-universe franchises, multi-volume series, or standalone novels, projects use a unified, isomorphic 3-level hierarchy layout:

1. **프랜차이즈 레벨 (Franchise Level)**: The project root directory (workspace root). Contains global `settings/` (shared lore, characters, worldview).
2. **작품 레벨 (Work Level)**: A subdirectory representing a specific novel/series (e.g., `work-a/`). Contains `series-bible.md` and work-specific `settings/` (local characters, items, overrides).
3. **권 레벨 (Volume Level)**: A subdirectory within the active work (e.g., `work-a/volume-1/`). Contains `outline.md` and `drafts/`.

### 1. Shared Universe Franchise Layout (다작품 구조)
```text
[project-root]/               # === 1단계: 프랜차이즈 레벨 (Franchise) ===
├── settings/                # 프랜차이즈 공통 설정 (전역 세계관 로어)
│   ├── magic-system.md
│   └── characters/
│       └── legendary-hero.md
│
├── [work-a]/                # === 2단계: 작품 레벨 (Work A) ===
│   ├── series-bible.md      # 작품 A 시리즈 바이블
│   ├── settings/            # 작품 A 전용 설정 (로컬 캐릭터/아이템)
│   │
│   ├── volume-1/            # === 3단계: 권 레벨 (Volume 1 of Work A) ===
│   │   ├── outline.md       # 1권 아웃라인 및 비트
│   │   ├── drafts/          # 1권 문단/챕터 드래프트
│   │   └── volume-1.epub    # 1권 출판 EPUB
│   └── volume-2/            # 3단계: 권 레벨 (Volume 2 of Work A)
│
└── [work-b]/                # === 2단계: 작품 레벨 (Work B) ===
    ├── series-bible.md
    └── volume-1/            # === 3단계: 권 레벨 (Volume 1 of Work B) ===
```

### 2. Standalone Work Layout (단독 작품 구조 - Isomorphic Fallback)
If `series-bible.md` is located directly at the project root, the project is treated as a single standalone work. The root acts as both the Franchise and Work level, and `volume-N/` directories are placed directly at the root:
```text
[project-root]/               # === 1단계 & 2단계 통합: 프랜차이즈 & 작품 레벨 ===
├── settings/                # 이 작품의 설정
├── series-bible.md          # 이 작품의 시리즈 바이블
│
├── volume-1/                # === 3단계: 권 레벨 (Volume 1) ===
│   ├── outline.md
│   └── drafts/
└── volume-2/                # === 3단계: 권 레벨 (Volume 2) ===
```

### Series Bible & Style Guide (`series-bible.md` & `settings/style-guide.md`)
The `series-bible.md` file tracks chronology, summaries of previous volumes, character evolution logs (e.g. ages, injuries, relationship modifications), and unresolved plot threads for the active work. 

**Work-Level Style Guide**: The prose style (style, tone, vocabulary preferences, and specific author/person style imitation targets) is formally declared in either the `## Style Guide` section of `series-bible.md` or a local config file at `settings/style-guide.md` at the active Work level. The `@novelist` router and `@novelist-loremaster` automatically inherit and propagate these style settings, ensuring that all volumes and drafts written under this Work maintain a consistent, unified prose style without requiring manual style declarations in every prompt.

## Usage Examples

### Novelist Router (auto-routing with feedback loop)

```text
/novelist Write the opening scene of a dark fantasy Chapter 1
  → ①Loremaster → ②Writer → ③Otaku → (④Editor → ③re-verify if needed) → ⑥Done

/novelist This scene's pacing feels slow, please fix it
  → @novelist-editor → @novelist-otaku verify

/novelist Write a LaTeX paper from this project's experiment results
  → @novelist-researcher
```

### Standalone Sub-agent Calls

```text
/novelist-writer Write an urban fantasy Chapter 3 opening scene.
/novelist-editor Review this chapter for plot and character consistency.
/novelist-loremaster Collect all setting info about the main character.
/novelist-otaku Verify this draft against the established setting.
```

### Lyricist Router

```text
/lyricist Write a sad ballad chorus about breakup regret
  → @lyricist-writer

/lyricist The hook in this lyric feels weak, polish it
  → @lyricist-editor
```

## Language, Culture & Creative Profiling Policy

Agents write in the language and style explicitly requested by the user. 

1. **Upfront Information Gathering**: If key parameters such as Style/Tone, Mood/Atmosphere, Language, or Cultural Background are missing, ambiguous, or unclear from the user's initial prompt, the router agents (`/novelist`, `/lyricist`) will ask the user *once* at the beginning to gather and align these parameters.
2. **Unified Profile Enforcement**: These parameters are compiled into a unified **Writing & Creative Profile** (or **Lyric Profile**). The routers propagate this profile to all sub-agents (Writer, Editor, Otaku, Researcher, Loremaster). Every stage of the workflow—including initial drafting, review, editing/revising, and setting verification—strictly adheres to this profile to maintain creative consistency.
3. **Language Defaults**: If unspecified, the language defaults to Korean.
4. **Cultural Context Inference**: The cultural context is inferred based on the target language and its corresponding country/countries. If ambiguous, the agents prompt the user to input it.
5. **Korean-First Creative Writing**: Korean is the default context. When writing in Korean, agents write with Korean sentence rhythm, natural dialogue, genre conventions, emotional continuity, and cliche avoidance in mind, representing a Korean cultural background.

## Style and Imitation Policy

The system supports flexible style enforcement. Users can define the prose style in two ways:
1. **Direct Description**: Explicitly describe the stylistic attributes (e.g., "concise, hardboiled, short sentences, cold tone").
2. **Author/Person Imitation**: Request to emulate the signature prose style of a specific author or person (e.g., "Haruki Murakami style", "Kim Young-ha style").

The agents (Writer and Editor) will analyze the signature characteristics of the requested style (sentence structure, pacing, vocabulary preferences, dialogue patterns) and adapt their prose output to match it.

Good requests:

```text
Write the opening of a dark urban fantasy Chapter 1 in Haruki Murakami's style.
Write the next paragraph using a concise, hardboiled prose style.
Write a 90s ballad-style breakup chorus.
```

Avoid requests like:
- Direct copy-pasting and slightly rewriting copyrighted lyrics.
